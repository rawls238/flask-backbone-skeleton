# flask-backbone-skeleton
A skeleton Backbone-Marionette app that is served from Flask and uses Flask as its backend and that can be easily set up and deployed via elastic beanstalk. 
This is mainly for having the ability to quickly prototype apps without having to deal with the boilerplate and annoyance of setting everything up properly. It does not purport to be perfect or production-ready :). Feel free to PR any improvements.

A fork off this backbone skeleton: https://github.com/mezod/skeleton

Process for setup:

1) Launch a python web app with elastic beanstalk

2) In your new repository put this code

3) git push

4) eb deploy

5) profit
